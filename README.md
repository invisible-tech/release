# Setup

1. Add `NPM_TOKEN` environmental variable to your project on circleCI.

    To do this you will have to:
    
    - Go to `https://circleci.com/gh/invisible-tech/<your-project-name>/edit#env-vars` (replace \<your-project-name\>, e.g. gear)
    - Click on `Import Variable(s)`.
    - Select `NPM_TOKEN`.
      - If you don't have permission to do that, ask your superior to do it!
